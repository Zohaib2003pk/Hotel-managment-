# Hotel-managment-
🏨 Hotel Management System
This is a simple Java-based Hotel Management System implemented as part of your Software Construction/CCP assignment. The project includes core functionality for managing hotels and basic unit testing to ensure system correctness.
________________________________________
📌 Project Description
The Hotel Management System is a console/Java application designed to demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts and best practices. It includes basic classes and interactions such as:
•	Hotel and room management
•	Customer creation and handling
•	Reservation logic
•	Unit tests validating core components
This project follows clean coding standards and uses unit testing to verify that the logic performs as expected.

🛠️ How to Build and Run
1.	Clone the repository
2.	git clone https://github.com/Zohaib2003pk/Hotel-managment-
3.	Open the project in your Java IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code).
4.	Compile the code
o	If using an IDE, simply build/compile the project.
o	If using the command line:
o	javac HotelManagementSystem.java
5.	Run the application
6.	java HotelManagementSystem
7.	You should see program output demonstrating core operations like adding hotels and rooms.

🧪 Running Unit Tests
You already included a basic JUnit test class (Test_HotelManagementSystem.java). To run tests:
1.	Make sure Junit4  is configured in your project’s build path.
2.	Run the test file via your IDE’s test runner
OR
3.	If using build tools like Maven/Gradle, run:
4.	mvn test
or
gradle test
Tests verify the correctness of system behavior and help catch logic errors early.
